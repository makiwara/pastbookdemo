This is LAMP-based installation.

## home
Home is built static to the moment.
All you need is to go http://pastbook.projectabove.com/home/index.html

## app
App is built on Silex.
It requires Composer to set things up.

You will need to create config/db.php from db_sample.php: change USERNAME/PASSWORD to your mySQL credentials or use alternate configuration of Doctrine DBAL.
